# SpotMAP

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

**SpotMAP** is a complete end-to-end pipeline for robotic scene understanding and interactive mapping. It integrates on-board SLAM, volumetric 3D reconstruction, instance segmentation, dynamic scene graph generation, and affordance prediction â€” giving mobile robots the capability to build detailed maps and understand their surroundings with minimal human supervision.
