# SpotMAP: Robotic Scene Understanding and Mapping

Welcome to the **SpotMAP** project website!  
SpotMAP is a robust, modular pipeline for robotic scene reconstruction and semantic understanding, designed for use with mobile robots like Boston Dynamics Spot.

---

## 📌 What is SpotMAP?

SpotMAP brings together:
- **On-board SLAM** — for pose estimation and navigation
- **Volumetric 3D Reconstruction** — for accurate scene geometry
- **Instance Segmentation** — for recognizing and isolating objects
- **Dynamic Scene Graphs** — for structured, updatable scene understanding
- **Affordance Prediction** — for inferring how to interact with objects

This pipeline helps robots build rich, meaningful maps of their environments with minimal human input.
